    "Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is a numerical method for studying mechanical behavior of fluids and solids. The pyLabFEA package\n",
    "introduces a simple version of FEA for solid mechanics and elastic-plastic materials, which is fully written in Python. Due to\n",
    "its simplicity, it is well-suited for teaching, and its flexibility in constitutive modeling of materials makes it a useful research tool. See the [online documentation](https://ahartmaier.github.io/pyLabFEA) of the pyLabFEA package for detailed information.\n",

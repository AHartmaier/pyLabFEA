Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is a numerical method for studying problems in mechanics. 
The pyLabFEA package introduces a simple version of FEA for solid mechanics and elastic-plastic materials.
pyLabFEA is suited for teaching, due to its simplicity, and that offers a great flexibility in constitutive
modeling of materials.

The package contains several Jupyter notebooks with tutorials on FEA, homogenization of elastic and elastic-plastic
material behavior, and constitutive models based on machine learning algorithms, contained in subfolder ``notebooks''.

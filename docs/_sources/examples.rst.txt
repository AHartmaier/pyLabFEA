Application 1: Machine Learning Flow Rule for Hill-like plasticity
------------------------------------------------------------------

In this application, a machine learning algorithm is trained with 
data from an anisotropic Hill-like yield criterion to
be used as constitutive model for anisotropic plasticity of metals.

Application 2: Machine Learning Flow Rule for Tresca plasticity
---------------------------------------------------------------

In this application, a machine learning algorithm is trained with 
data from a Tresca yield criterion to
be used as constitutive model for isotropic plasticity of metals.

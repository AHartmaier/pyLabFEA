Jupyter notebooks
=================

The pyLabFEA package is conveniently used with Jupyter notebooks. 
Available notebooks with tutorials on linear and non-linear FEA,
homogenization of elastic and elastic-plastic material behavior, and
constitutive models based on machine learning algorithms are contained in
the directory 'notebooks' and can be accessed via ``index.ipynb``. 

The Jupyter notebooks of the pyLabFEA tutorials are directly accessible on `Binder`_

Examples
========

Python routines contained in the directory 'examples' demonstrate 

* how ML flow rules can be trained based on reference materials with significant plastic 
anisotropy, as Hill or Barlat reference materials, but also for isotropic J2 plasticity. 
The training data consists of different stress tensors that mark the onset of plastic 
yielding of the material. It is important that these stress tensors cover the onset of 
plastic yielding in the full 6-dimensional stress space, including normal and shear 
stresses. The trained ML flow rules can be used in form of a user material (UMAT) for 
the commercial FEA package Abaqus.

* how more complex 2D models can be setup, e.g. an elastic inclusion in an elasto-plastic 
matrix. Generally, models in pyLabFEA can have several sections where each section is 
associated to a different material. For structured meshes, the assignment of each element
to a section (or material) can be defined simply a 2D array, that has the same shape as
the arrangement of elements in the model.

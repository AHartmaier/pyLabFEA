Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is a numerical method for studying
problems in mechanics. The pyLabFEA package introduces a simple version
of FEA for solid mechanics and elastic-plastic materials. pyLabFEA is
suited for teaching, due to its simplicity, and that offers a great
flexibility in constitutive modeling of materials.

The package contains several Jupyter notebooks with tutorials on FEA,
homogenization of elastic and elastic-plastic material behavior, and
constitutive models based on machine learning algorithms, contained in
subfolder ``notebooks``.

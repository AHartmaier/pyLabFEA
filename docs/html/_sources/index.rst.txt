Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is a numerical method for studying
mechanical behavior of fluids and solids. The pyLabFEA package introduces a simple version
of FEA for solid mechanics and elastic-plastic materials, which is
fully written in Python. Due to its simplicity, it is well-suited for teaching, and
its flexibility in constitutive modeling of materials makes it a useful 
research tool.
